# MeetMic

[Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) microphone control powered by firestore to control google meet microphone

## Why?
Started when I need to take online lession during quaruntine, I have spent most of my time on my bed instead of the screen. So when the teacher calls me, I need to get up and open the microphone on my computer.

Instead of doing that, Why not just create an app that will fulfill my laziness?

## Getting Started
1. Open this [web](https://meetmic.vercel.app/) on your mobile (or the device that you wish to use as an controller).
2. Install this [extension](https://github.com/wit03/MeetMic-extension) on the computer that you wish to join the Google meet.
3. Enter the pin code as its shown on the Google Meet
4. Enjoy your lazy life!
